# Tombstone - Grit & Determination System Reference Document (v.0.1)

**Tombstone 0 Grit & Determination** is licensed under [CC-BY-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/).  


**Tombstone - Grit & Determination** is an adventure game for one referee (the **Ranger**) and at least one other player.
Players act as hardened adventurers exploring a badland filled with odd folk, gamblin', and danger in them thar hills!

## Overview
Fill this in later

### Neutral Arbiter
The Ranger's role is to portray the world and the individual that reside in it clearly and effectively, while remaining neutral.

### Classless
A character is not defined by a line on the sheet, but by the grit in their heart and the iron on their hip.

### Death
Thunder Mesa County is a dangerous place and while the characters are rootin' and tootin', death is around the corner, but it should never be a shot in the back.

### Know when to hold them
Drawing from the deck is dangerous, and it may not go in the characters' favor. Plans should be careful, and cards drawn when only when the threat of failure could mean death.

### Growth
Characters should shape and be shaped by the events of the world. New skills and abilities should be earned by overcoming dangerous obstacles and harrowing adventures.

### Player Choice
Players should always know and understand the high level consequences of their actions. Picking up a rattlesnake might not end in death, but it should be given as a risk.

### Shared Objectives
Players trust one another to engage with the shared setting, character goals, and party challenges. Therefore, the party is typically working together towards a common goal, as a team.

## Principles for Wardens
### Information
- Provide useful information about the game world as the characters explore it.
- Players do not need to draw cards to learn about their circumstances.
- Be helpful and direct with your answers to their questions.
- Respond honestly, describe consistently, and always let them know they can keep asking questions.

### Difficulty
- Default to context and realism rather than numbers and mechanics.
- If something the players want to do is sincerely impossible, no card drawn will allow them to do it.
- Is what the player describes and how they leverage the situation sensible? Let it happen.
- Saves cover a great deal of uncertain situations and are often all that is necessary for risky actions.

### Preparation
- The game world is organic, malleable and random. It intuits and makes sharp turns.
- Use random tables and generators to develop situations, not stories or plots.
- NPCs remember what the PCs say and do, and how they affect the world.
- NPCs don't want to die. Infuse their own self-interest and will to live into every personality.

### Narrative Focus
- Emergent experience of play is what matters, not math or character abilities. Give the players weapon trainers and personal quests to facilitate improvement and specialization.
- Pay attention to the needs and wants of the players, then put realistic opportunities in their path.
- A dagger to your throat will kill you, regardless of your expensive armor and impressive training.

### Danger
- The game world produces real risk of pain and death for the player characters.
- Telegraph serious danger to players when it is present. The more dangerous, the more obvious.
- Put traps in plain sight and let the players take time to figure out a solution.
- Give players opportunities to solve problems and interact with the world.

### Treasure
- A Treasure is specific to the environment from where it is recovered. It tells a story.
- Treasure is highly valuable, almost always bulky, and rarely useful beyond its worth and prestige.
- Relics are not Treasure, though they are useful and interesting.
- Use Treasure as a lure to exotic locations under the protection of intimidating foes.

### Choice
- Give players a solid choice to force outcomes when the situation lulls.
- Use binary "so, A or B?" responses when their intentions are vague.
- Work together using this conversational method to keep the game moving.
- Ensure that the player character's actions leave their mark on the game world.

### Die of Fate
- Occasionally you will want an element of randomness (e.g. the weather, unique character knowledge, etc.).
- In these situations, roll 1d6. A roll of 4 or more generally favors the players.
- A roll of 3 or under tends to mean bad luck for the PCs or their allies.

## Principles for Players
### Agency
- Attributes and related saves do not define your character. They are tools.
- Don't ask only what your character would do, ask what you would do, too.
- Be creative with your intuition, items, and connections.

### Teamwork
- Seek consensus from the other players before barreling forward.
- Stay on the same page about goals and limits, respecting each other and accomplishing more as a group than alone.

### Exploration
- Asking questions and listening to detail is more useful than any stats, items, or skills you have.
- Take the Warden's description without suspicion, but don't shy away from seeking more information.
- There is no single correct way forward.

### Talking
- Treat NPCs as if they were real people, and rely on your curiosity to safely gain information and solve problems.
- You'll find that most people are interesting and will want to talk things through before getting violent.

### Caution
- Fighting is a choice and rarely a wise one; consider whether violence is the best way to achieve your goals.
- Try to stack the odds in your favor and retreat when things seem unfavorable.

### Planning
- Think of ways to avoid your obstacles through reconnaissance, subtlety, and fact-finding.
- Do some research and ask around about your objectives.

### Ambition
- Set goals and use your meager means to take steps forward.
- Expect nothing. Earn your reputation.
- Keep things moving forward and play to see what happens.

## Character Creation

### Name, Background, Traits
Before you start draw, choose your character's name and background. A PC's background influences their knowledge and skills. 

Stat Generation:
Players will shuffle a standard 52 card deck including the red and black jokers.
Players will generate 3 hands of 5 cards and add up the quality of cards drawn, and assign them to your stats in order.
Black Joker: 0
Ace through 5: 1
6 through 10: 2
Jack through King: 3
Red Joker: 4

There is a chance that a character gets a number higer than 18. If a character would have an ability score over 18 that ability score is 18, and any remaining points are transferred to the character's Luck ability.

Once each hand is drawn, note any pairs.

### Ability Scores
Player Characters (PCs) have just four attributes:
Strength (STR), Dexterity (DEX), Grit (GRT), and Luck (Lck). When creating a PC, the player should draw 3 hands of 5 for each of their characterâ€™s ability scores, in order. They may then swap any two of the results. They also have "fourth" ability called Luck. This ability is a pool that fills and empties throughout play and can start filled if a character is lucky enough to have an ability score over 18.

### Hit Protection (HP)
Draw 2 cards and use the above quality to determine starting Hit Protection (HP), add the number of pairs to starting Hit Protection.

### Inventory

Characters have a total of 10 inventory slots: a backpack with six slots, one slot for each hand, and two slots for their upper body (such as the belt, chest, or head).

Most items take up one slot, and small items can be bundled together. Slots are abstract and can be rearranged per the Wardenâ€™s discretion.

Bulky items take up two slots and are typically two-handed or awkward to carry. Anyone carrying a full inventory (i.e. filling all 10 slots) is reduced to 0 HP.

A PC cannot carry more items than their inventory allows. Carts (which must be pulled with both hands), horses, or mules can increase inventory. Hirelings can also be paid to carry equipment.

## Optional Archetypes

While Tombstone doesn't have classes, the wild west holds a special visual appeal in the minds of players, and sometimes players just want to select a package and get to playing.

## Rules
### Ability scores
Each of the four **ability scores** are used in different circumstances throughout play (see **saves** below).


**Strength (STR)**: Used for saves that test physicality, stopping a lassoed bull, throwing a chunk of dynamite, resiting rot gut at the local tavern, etc...

**Dexterity (DEX)**: Used for saves that test agility, speed, and reflexes like jumping aboard a train, firing a gun, balancing, etc...

**Grit (GRT)**: Used for saves that test determination in faces of adversity and getting your way, like trying to intimidate, persuade, or deceive. Also used to overcome fear, terror, etc...

**Luck (LCK)**: Used as a resource to effect draws and to cheat the hand of fate dealt to you.

### Saves
A save is a roll to avoid misfortune in the badlands and comes from taking risks. PCs draw a card for an appropriate ability score. If they draw a card equal to or under that ability score, they pass, otherwise they fail. A Red Joker is always a success, and a Black Joker is always a failure. Luck cannot be spent to avoid a Black Joker.

 </summary>
 _Jesse encounters a group of heavily-armed bandits standing guard before a tunnel entrance. Her player carefully plots a course, recognizing that her 12 DEX makes sneaking past the guards the best option. She draws 1 card, a Nine of Spades, a success!_
</details>

### Healing
Resting for a few minutes and having a drink of water or a bite of food restores lost HP, but leaves the party exposed to danger. Ability score loss (see **Critical Damage**) can usually be restored with a week's rest in a dry bed, a bath, and some homecooked food (i.e. not rations). Extensive wounds may require paying a physician and extended time resting.

### Exhaustion
A PC that is **exhausted** of crucial resources (such as food and water) is unable to recover HP or Ability scores. Anyone exhausted of resources for more than a day adds **Fatigue** to their inventory for each day they've been without necessary supplies. Each Fatigue takes up one slot in a PCs inventory and lasts until they are able to recuperate (such as a good night's rest and a meal in a safehouse). PCs can also gain Fatigue through the fiction.

### Armor 
? Do we even have armor in the old west? Maybe a good leather duster provides 1 armor and takes up 1 slot?

### Reactions
When PCs encounter an NPC whose reaction to the party is not obvious, the Ranger may make a player Draw and consult the following table:

| Number      	| Spades  	| Hearts  	| Diamonds 	| Clubs   	|
|:-------------:	|:---------:	|:---------:	|:----------:	|:---------:	|
| Black Joker 	| Hostile 	| Hostile 	| Hostile  	| Hostile 	|
| A - 5       	| Wary    	| Curious 	| Kind     	| Helpful 	|
| 6 - 9       	| Curious 	| Kind    	| Helpful  	| Wary    	|
| 10 - 12     	| Kind    	| Helpful 	| Wary     	| Curious 	|
| 13          	| Helpful 	| Wary    	| Curious  	| Kind    	|
| Red Joker   	| Ally    	| Ally    	| Ally     	| Ally    	|

### Morale
Enemies must pass a GRT save to avoid fleeing when they take their first casualty and again when they lose half their number. Groups (e.g. bandits and lawmen) may use their leader's GRT in place of their own. Solo enemies must save when they're reduced to 0 HP. PCs never have to make morale saves.

### Hirelings
PCs can hire **Hirelings** to aid them in their expedition. To create a hireling draw 3 for each ability score, then draw 1 for HP and give them a hand weapon (Draw 2). You use the **Backgrounds & Traits** section to further flesh them out. Hirelings cost between 1 and 3 dollars per week, or a share of treasure the group obtains.

### Wealth & Treasure
MOst people in Thunder Mesa County use the dollar, backed by the United States of America. The dollar is equal 2 silver half dollars, 4 quarters, 10 dimes, 20 nickels, and 100 cents. Outside of the currency system, gold and silver can be found in veins of the caves of the Big Thunder Mining Co.

Treasure such as mined gold, safes of bank notes, relics dug up or stolen are highly valuable, usually bulky, and almost always useless beyond its value.

Towns, cities, or trading posts along a railroad barter and trade for this treasure, though fencing stolen goods may cause more problems than the wealth fixes.

## Combat

### Rounds
The game usually plays without strict time tracking. In a fight or any instance where time is of the essence, use Turns to keep track of when something occurs. A **round** is roughly ten seconds of in-game time and during a round all characters (PC and NPC) get a turn.

### Initiative
Before each round, one player (decided by the group) makes a DEX save. If it's a success then the party acts first. If it fails, then the enemies act first. If the Black Joker is drawn, the party fails and the Ranger is encouraged to add a complication to the combat encounter (e.g. a powder keg blows up, a horse runs wild, etc...)

### Actions 
During a turn, a character may move up to 25 feet and take an action. This can be firing a gun, swinging a weapon, moving again, take a swig of whiskey, or some other action that makes sense given the time constraints.

When it is the party's turn to act, the players may take their turn in any order.

  <summary>
Expand For Example
 </summary>
 _Jesse has accidentally stumbled onto the camp of the One Eye gang. In order to make a move before the bandits, she makes a DEX save. She fails, and the Bandits gets to attack first._
</details>

### Attacks & Damage
The defender makes a DEX save. If it is successful, the attack is avoided. If it fails, the attack hits. The attacker draws a number of cards from the deck and deals damage equal to the highest tier of card drawn. 

<details markdown="block">
  <summary>
Expand For Example
 </summary>
 _A nearby bandit rushes Jesse, swinging its club at her, who has 5 HP. The club is a hand weapon that Draws 2 damage. Jesse's player makes a DEX save and draws a King, which is higher than her 12 Dexterity. The Bandit's club hits and Jesse draws 2 cards, an Ace and a 8. The 8 is tier 2. Jesse takes 2 damage and has 3 HP remaining._
</details>

If the Black Joker is drawn at any point (DEX save or damage), the attack deals no damage, and misfortune has befallen the attacker.

### Multiple Attackers
If multiple attackers target the same PC, make 1 DEX save, if the save fails, add 1 card drawn for each addtional attack. In addition, the final damage is increased by a total of 1.

### Attack Modifiers
If fighting from an advantagous position (such as against a helpless foe, or through a well coordinated attack), the attack is **enhanced**, forcing the defender to draw 1 extra card for the DEX save and taking the worst result.

If fighting from a poor position (such as in the dark, or while riding on a galloping horse), the attack is considered **impaired**, forcing the defender to draw 1 extra card from the DEX save and taking the best result.

### Critical Damage
Damage that reduces a target's HP below 0 carries over to STR, reducing it until all damage has been dealt. They must make a STR save or take **critical damage**.

If the Red Joker is drawn for damage, regardless of how much HP the target has, they must make a STR save as Lady Luck has blessed the attack with supernatural panache.

Any PC that fails the STR save suffers critical damage and is out of the fight. If their wounds are treated and they're able to rest, they will recover. If left untreated, they die within the hour.

### Ability Score loss
If a PCs STR is reduced to 0, they die and their story ends. If their DEX is reduced to 0, they are unable to move. If their GRT is reduced to 0, they are too cowardly to continue adventuring.
Complete DEX and GRT loss renders the character unable to act until the are restored through extended and most likely costly rest.

### Scars
When damage to a PC reduces their HP to exactly 0, they may be changed by the hand fate has dealt them and changed forever. See the [**Scars**] table for more.

### Unconscious & Death
When a character dies, the player is free to create a new character or take control of a hireling. The immediately join the party in order to reduce downtime. If the player takes control of a hireling, they immediately Draw 2 for each stat and Draw 1 for their HP bringing them closer to the rest of the party.

### Posses
Large groups of similar fighters, like bandits, outlaws, lawmen are treated as a single **posse**. When a posse takes critical damage, it is routed or otherwise weakend. When it reaches 0 STR, it is destroyed.

Attacks against a posse by individuals are **impaired**
Attacks against individuals by a posse are **enhanced** and increase the final damage by 3 (this overrides the additional 1 damage from multiple attackers, as a posse is already a group of multiple attackers just more organized).

### Turning Tail
Running away from a gunfight always requires a successful DEX save, as well as a safe destination. This is why groups of bandits and outlaws may have several safe houses or hideouts to retreat to when a plan goes poorly.
