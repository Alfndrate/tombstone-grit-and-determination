# Tombstone - Grit & Determination System Reference Document (v.0.1)

**Tombstone 0 Grit & Determination** is licensed under [CC-BY-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/).  


**Tombstone - Grit & Determination** is an adventure game for one referee (the **Ranger**) and at least one other player.
Players act as hardened adventurers exploring a badland filled with odd folk, gamblin', and danger in them thar hills!

## Overview
Fill this in later

### Neutral Arbiter
The Ranger's role is to portray the world and the individual that reside in it clearly and effectively, while remaining neutral.

### Classless
A character is not defined by a line on the sheet, but by the grit in their heart and the iron on their hip.

### Death
Thunder Mesa County is a dangerous place and while the characters are rootin' and tootin', death is around the corner, but it should never be a shot in the back.

### Know when to hold them
Drawing from the deck is dangerous, and it may not go in the characters' favor. Plans should be careful, and cards drawn when only when the threat of failure could mean death.

### Growth
Characters should shape and be shaped by the events of the world. New skills and abilities should be earned by overcoming dangerous obstacles and harrowing adventures.

### Player Choice
Players should always know and understand the high level consequences of their actions. Picking up a rattlesnake might not end in death, but it should be given as a risk.

### Shared Objectives
Players trust one another to engage with the shared setting, character goals, and party challenges. Therefore, the party is typically working together towards a common goal, as a team.

## Principles for Wardens
### Information
- Provide useful information about the game world as the characters explore it.
- Players do not need to draw cards to learn about their circumstances.
- Be helpful and direct with your answers to their questions.
- Respond honestly, describe consistently, and always let them know they can keep asking questions.

### Difficulty
- Default to context and realism rather than numbers and mechanics.
- If something the players want to do is sincerely impossible, no card drawn will allow them to do it.
- Is what the player describes and how they leverage the situation sensible? Let it happen.
- Saves cover a great deal of uncertain situations and are often all that is necessary for risky actions.

### Preparation
- The game world is organic, malleable and random. It intuits and makes sharp turns.
- Use random tables and generators to develop situations, not stories or plots.
- NPCs remember what the PCs say and do, and how they affect the world.
- NPCs don't want to die. Infuse their own self-interest and will to live into every personality.

### Narrative Focus
- Emergent experience of play is what matters, not math or character abilities. Give the players weapon trainers and personal quests to facilitate improvement and specialization.
- Pay attention to the needs and wants of the players, then put realistic opportunities in their path.
- A dagger to your throat will kill you, regardless of your expensive armor and impressive training.

### Danger
- The game world produces real risk of pain and death for the player characters.
- Telegraph serious danger to players when it is present. The more dangerous, the more obvious.
- Put traps in plain sight and let the players take time to figure out a solution.
- Give players opportunities to solve problems and interact with the world.

### Treasure
- A Treasure is specific to the environment from where it is recovered. It tells a story.
- Treasure is highly valuable, almost always bulky, and rarely useful beyond its worth and prestige.
- Relics are not Treasure, though they are useful and interesting.
- Use Treasure as a lure to exotic locations under the protection of intimidating foes.

### Choice
- Give players a solid choice to force outcomes when the situation lulls.
- Use binary "so, A or B?" responses when their intentions are vague.
- Work together using this conversational method to keep the game moving.
- Ensure that the player character's actions leave their mark on the game world.

### Die of Fate
- Occasionally you will want an element of randomness (e.g. the weather, unique character knowledge, etc.).
- In these situations, roll 1d6. A roll of 4 or more generally favors the players.
- A roll of 3 or under tends to mean bad luck for the PCs or their allies.

## Principles for Players
### Agency
- Attributes and related saves do not define your character. They are tools.
- Don't ask only what your character would do, ask what you would do, too.
- Be creative with your intuition, items, and connections.

### Teamwork
- Seek consensus from the other players before barreling forward.
- Stay on the same page about goals and limits, respecting each other and accomplishing more as a group than alone.

### Exploration
- Asking questions and listening to detail is more useful than any stats, items, or skills you have.
- Take the Warden's description without suspicion, but don't shy away from seeking more information.
- There is no single correct way forward.

### Talking
- Treat NPCs as if they were real people, and rely on your curiosity to safely gain information and solve problems.
- You'll find that most people are interesting and will want to talk things through before getting violent.

### Caution
- Fighting is a choice and rarely a wise one; consider whether violence is the best way to achieve your goals.
- Try to stack the odds in your favor and retreat when things seem unfavorable.

### Planning
- Think of ways to avoid your obstacles through reconnaissance, subtlety, and fact-finding.
- Do some research and ask around about your objectives.

### Ambition
- Set goals and use your meager means to take steps forward.
- Expect nothing. Earn your reputation.
- Keep things moving forward and play to see what happens.

## Character Creation

### Name, Background, Traits
Before you start draw, choose your character's name and background. A PC's background influences their knowledge and skills. 

Stat Generation:
Players will shuffle a standard 52 card deck including the red and black jokers.
Players will generate 3 hands of 5 cards and add up the quality of cards drawn, and assign them to your stats in order.
Black Joker: 0
Ace through 5: 1
6 through 10: 2
Jack through King: 3
Red Joker: 4

There is a chance that a character gets a number higer than 18. If a character would have an ability score over 18 that ability score is 18, and any remaining points are transferred to the character's Luck ability.

Once each hand is drawn, note any pairs.

### Ability Scores
Player Characters (PCs) have just four attributes:
Strength (STR), Dexterity (DEX), Grit (GRT), and Luck (Lck). When creating a PC, the player should draw 3 hands of 5 for each of their characterâ€™s ability scores, in order. They may then swap any two of the results. They also have "fourth" ability called Luck. This ability is a pool that fills and empties throughout play and can start filled if a character is lucky enough to have an ability score over 18.

### Hit Protection
Draw 2 cards and use the above quality to determine starting Hit Protection, add the number of pairs to starting Hit Protection.

### Inventory

Characters have a total of 10 inventory slots: a backpack with six slots, one slot for each hand, and two slots for their upper body (such as the belt, chest, or head).

Most items take up one slot, and small items can be bundled together. Slots are abstract and can be rearranged per the Wardenâ€™s discretion.

Bulky items take up two slots and are typically two-handed or awkward to carry. Anyone carrying a full inventory (i.e. filling all 10 slots) is reduced to 0 HP.

A PC cannot carry more items than their inventory allows. Carts (which must be pulled with both hands), horses, or mules can increase inventory. Hirelings can also be paid to carry equipment.

## Optional Archetypes

While Tombstone doesn't have classes, the wild west holds a special visual appeal in the minds of players, and sometimes players just want to select a package and get to playing.
