# Tombstone - Grit & Determination System Reference Document (v.0.1)

**Tombstone - Grit & Determination** is licensed under [CC-BY-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/).  


**Tombstone - Grit & Determination** is an adventure game for one referee (the **Dealer**) and at least one other player.
Players act as hardened adventurers exploring a badland filled with odd folk, gamblin', and danger in them thar hills!

## Overview
Fill this in later

### Neutral Arbiter
The Dealer's role is to portray the world and the individual that reside in it clearly and effectively, while remaining neutral. This may seem counter-intuitive as the Dealer also has a deck, but the deck takes the place of dice in Tombstone, and is meant to introduce elements of randomization and chaos.

### Classless
A character is not defined by a line on the sheet, but by the grit in their heart and the iron on their hip.

### Death
The badlands are a dangerous place and while the characters are rootin' and tootin', death is around the corner, but it should never be a shot in the back, unless the Dealer is chicken-livered.

### Know when to hold them
Drawing from the deck is dangerous, and it may not go in the characters' favor. Plans should be careful, and cards drawn when only when the threat of failure could mean death.

### Growth
Characters should shape and be shaped by the events of the world. New skills and abilities should be earned by overcoming dangerous obstacles and harrowing adventures.

### Player Choice
Players should always know and understand the high level consequences of their actions. Picking up a rattlesnake might not end in death, but it should be given as a risk.

### Shared Objectives
Players trust one another to engage with the shared setting, character goals, and party challenges. Therefore, the party is typically working together towards a common goal, as a team.

## Principles for Dealers

### Information
- Provide useful information about the game world as the characters explore it.
- Players do not need to draw cards to learn about their circumstances.
- Be helpful and direct with your answers to their questions.
- Respond honestly, describe consistently, and always let them know they can keep asking questions.

### Difficulty
- Default to context and realism rather than numbers and mechanics.
- If something the players want to do is sincerely impossible, no card drawn will allow them to do it.
- Is what the player describes and how they leverage the situation sensible? Let it happen.
- Saves cover a great deal of uncertain situations and are often all that is necessary for risky actions.

### Preparation
- The game world is organic, malleable and random. It intuits and makes sharp turns.
- Use random tables and generators to develop situations, not stories or plots.
- NPCs remember what the PCs say and do, and how they affect the world.
- NPCs don't want to die. Infuse their own self-interest and will to live into every personality.

### Narrative Focus
- Emergent experience of play is what matters, not math or character abilities. Give the players weapon trainers and personal quests to facilitate improvement and specialization.
- Pay attention to the needs and wants of the players, then put realistic opportunities in their path.
- A dagger to your throat will kill you, regardless of your expensive armor and impressive training.

### Danger
- The game world produces real risk of pain and death for the player characters.
- Telegraph serious danger to players when it is present. The more dangerous, the more obvious.
- Put traps in plain sight and let the players take time to figure out a solution.
- Give players opportunities to solve problems and interact with the world.

### Treasure
- A Treasure is specific to the environment from where it is recovered. It tells a story.
- Treasure is highly valuable, almost always bulky, and rarely useful beyond its worth and prestige.
- Relics are not Treasure, though they are useful and interesting.
- Use Treasure as a lure to exotic locations under the protection of intimidating foes.

### Choice
- Give players a solid choice to force outcomes when the situation lulls.
- Use binary "so, A or B?" responses when their intentions are vague.
- Work together using this conversational method to keep the game moving.
- Ensure that the player character's actions leave their mark on the game world.

### Die of Fate
- Occasionally you will want an element of randomness (e.g. the weather, unique character knowledge, etc.).
- In these situations, roll 1d6. A roll of 4 or more generally favors the players.
- A roll of 3 or under tends to mean bad luck for the PCs or their allies.

## Principles for Players
### Agency
- Attributes and related saves do not define your character. They are tools.
- Don't ask only what your character would do, ask what you would do, too.
- Be creative with your intuition, items, and connections.

### Teamwork
- Seek consensus from the other players before barreling forward.
- Stay on the same page about goals and limits, respecting each other and accomplishing more as a group than alone.

### Exploration
- Asking questions and listening to detail is more useful than any stats, items, or skills you have.
- Take the Dealer's description without suspicion, but don't shy away from seeking more information.
- There is no single correct way forward.

### Talking
- Treat NPCs as if they were real people, and rely on your curiosity to safely gain information and solve problems.
- You'll find that most people are interesting and will want to talk things through before getting violent.

### Caution
- Fighting is a choice and rarely a wise one; consider whether violence is the best way to achieve your goals.
- Try to stack the odds in your favor and retreat when things seem unfavorable.

### Planning
- Think of ways to avoid your obstacles through reconnaissance, subtlety, and fact-finding.
- Do some research and ask around about your objectives.

### Ambition
- Set goals and use your meager means to take steps forward.
- Expect nothing. Earn your reputation.
- Keep things moving forward and play to see what happens.

## Character Creation
 
### Ability Scores and Stat Generation
Stat Generation:
Players will shuffle a standard 52 card deck including the red and black jokers.
Players will draw 7 cards and divide them by suit. Each card in a particular suit gives +1 to that ability score. This means a player could have 7 in 1 ability score and 0 in the other 3. That is okay! These are modifiers applied to cards drawn through the course of play, with the exception of GRT which is a character's Hit Protection.
Spades = Strength (STR)
Clubs = Dexterity (DEX)
Diamonds = Will (WIL)
Hearts = Grit (GRT)

### Hit Protection (HP)
A character's GRT ability score + 1 will be the character's Hit Protection. When players take damage *in combat*, damage is dealt to Hit Protection first.

## Names, Backgrounds, & Traits

### Inventory

Characters have a total of 10 inventory slots: a backpack with six slots, one slot for each hand, and two slots for their upper body (such as the belt, chest, or head). Overall, this inventory system is supposed to be firm, but abstract. A character can carry 9 large books in both hands, but they won't have the ability to carry much else.

Most items take up one slot, and small items can be bundled together. Slots are abstract and can be rearranged per the Dealer’s discretion.

Bulky items take up two slots and are typically two-handed or awkward to carry. Anyone carrying a full inventory (i.e. filling all 10 slots) is reduced to 0 HP.

A PC cannot carry more items than their inventory allows. Carts (which must be pulled with both hands), horses, or mules can increase inventory. Hirelings can also be paid to carry equipment.

## Optional Archetypes

While Tombstone doesn't have classes, the wild west holds a special visual appeal in the minds of players, and sometimes players just want to select a package and get to playing.

## Rules
### The Deck of fate
Each player including the Dealer needs a standard 52 card deck of playing cards with 2 jokers.

At the beginning of a session, every player shuffles their deck several times and offers it to the Dealer for a cut. Then each player draws 5 cards. They may use these cards in play to cheat the hand that fate has dealt them. Players can only draw a new hand of 5 after a full night's rest or if their deck is empty.

To cheat fate, a player may place 1 card in their hand on top of the card drawn for any contested action (e.g. Attacks or Saves). This can turn a missed attack or a failed save into a success. Players can only cheat fate on damage if the attack is **enhanced**.

#### Card Values, Suits, & Quality
Each card in the deck has a value and a suit printed on it. When making contested actions, add the number printed on the card to your modifier when comparing values. Aces are worth 1, Jacks are worth 11, Queens are worth 12, and Kings are worth 13.

The suits of cards are also used when determining ties on contested actions. Each ability score is tied to suit and used for those type of contested actions.

  <summary>
Expand For Example
 </summary>
 _Jesse is being robbed while riding on a train. She decides to lie to the bandit about the valuables on her person. She makes a contested WIL action by flipping a card from her deck and gets an 8 of Diamonds. Her WIL is 2 and she gets a total of 10. The Dealer flips a 10 of Spades with no modifier. Jesse ties the bandit, but her suit trumps the bandits and she succeeds on her lie!_
</details>

Each card falls into a quality level that represents how good the card is. Most often these tiers will be used when determining damage, but may be used in other instances.
A - 5: Tier 1
6 - 10: Tier 2
Jack - King: Tier 3

#### The Two jokers
Each deck has both a **Black Joker** and a **Red Joker**. These two cards represent the random nature of fate. 

When flipped from the deck, the Black Joker is always a failure and may not be cheated away. If flipped for damage, the attack deals no damage, and the attacker suffers misfortune. A player may use the Black Joker if it is in their hand to to *force* the Dealer to reflip a card. The second result must be used, and cannot be cheated even by another Black Joker. The Black Joker cannot effect the Red Joker.
When flipped from the deck, the Red Joker is always a success and of the appropriate suit. If flipped for damage, the attack deals Tier 3 damage plus an additional flip from the deck. If the Black Joker is flipped for this addtional damage, the attack still deals Tier 3 damage.

#### Contested actions
Often you will be asked to flip a card. This can be in regards to making an attack, dodging an attack, making a save. A contested action is *usually* against the dealer, but sometimes it may be against a specific target number. That number is generally 9.

### Ability scores
Each of the four **ability scores** are used in different circumstances throughout play (see **Saves** below).


**Strength (STR)**: Used for contested actions and saves that test physicality, stopping a lassoed bull, throwing a chunk of dynamite, etc...

**Dexterity (DEX)**: Used for contested actions and saves that test agility, speed, and reflexes like jumping aboard a train, firing a gun, balancing, etc...

**Will (WIL)**: Used for contested actions and saves that test determination in faces of adversity and getting your way, like trying to intimidate, persuade, or deceive. Also used to overcome fear, terror, etc...

**Grit (GRT)**: Used for contested actions and saves that that test your ability to shrug off the dangers of the badlands. Dealing with snake poison, resiting rot gut at the local tavern, etc...

### Saves
A save is a flip to avoid misfortune in the badlands and comes from taking risks. PCs draw a card from the deck for an appropriate ability score. The Dealer considers the risk level and adjusts the target number necessary for the save to succeed.

The standard target number for a save is 9.

Low Risk: 10
Moderate Risk: 11
High Risk: 12
Deadly Risk: 13

 _Jesse encounters a group of heavily-armed bandits standing guard before a tunnel entrance. Her player carefully plots a course, recognizing that her 4 DEX makes sneaking past the guards the best option. She draws 1 card, an 6 of Spades, Jesse adds her 4 DEX and gets a 10. Sneaking into the Bandit camp is high risk action, needing a 12. She's been spotted!_
</details>

### Healing
Resting for a few minutes and having a drink of water or a bite of food restores lost HP, but leaves the party exposed to danger. Ability score loss (see **Critical Damage**) can usually be restored with a week's rest in a dry bed, a bath, and some homecooked food (i.e. not rations). Extensive wounds may require paying a physician and extended time resting.

### Exhaustion
A PC that is **exhausted** of crucial resources (such as food and water) is unable to recover HP or Ability scores. Anyone exhausted of resources for more than a day adds **Fatigue** to their inventory for each day they've been without necessary supplies. Each Fatigue takes up one slot in a PCs inventory and lasts until they are able to recuperate (such as a good night's rest and a meal in a safehouse). PCs can also gain Fatigue through the fiction.

### Reactions
When PCs encounter an NPC whose reaction to the party is not obvious, the Dealer draws 1 card from their deck and compares the results to the table below:

| Number      	| Spades  	| Hearts  	| Diamonds 	| Clubs   	|
|:-------------:	|:---------:	|:---------:	|:----------:	|:---------:	|
| Black Joker 	| Hostile 	| Hostile 	| Hostile  	| Hostile 	|
| A - 5       	| Wary    	| Curious 	| Kind     	| Helpful 	|
| 6 - 9       	| Curious 	| Kind    	| Helpful  	| Wary    	|
| 10 - 12     	| Kind    	| Helpful 	| Wary     	| Curious 	|
| 13          	| Helpful 	| Wary    	| Curious  	| Kind    	|
| Red Joker   	| Ally    	| Ally    	| Ally     	| Ally    	|

### Morale Save
Enemies must pass a 9 on a WIL save to avoid fleeing when they take their first casualty (no risk) and again when they lose half their number (high risk). Groups (e.g. bandits and lawmen) may use their leader's WIL in place of their own. Solo enemies must save when they're reduced to 0 HP. PCs never have to pass a morale save.

### Hirelings
PCs can hire **Hirelings** to aid them in their expedition. To create a hireling draw 4 cards and divide them by suit. Give them an improvised weapon (1/2/3). You use the **Backgrounds & Traits** section to further flesh them out. Hirelings cost between 1 and 3 dollars per week, or a share of treasure the group obtains.

### Wealth & Treasure
Most people in the badlands use the dollar, backed by the United States of America. The dollar is equal 2 silver half dollars, 4 quarters, 10 dimes, 20 nickels, and 100 cents. Outside of the currency system, gold and silver can be found in veins of the caves of the local Mining Co.

Treasure such as mined gold, safes of bank notes, relics dug up or stolen are highly valuable, usually bulky, and almost always useless beyond its value.

Towns, cities, or trading posts along a railroad barter and trade for this treasure, though fencing stolen goods may cause more problems than the wealth fixes.

## Combat

### Rounds
The game usually plays without strict time tracking. In a fight or any instance where time is of the essence, use Turns to keep track of when something occurs. A **round** is roughly ten seconds of in-game time and during a round all characters (PC and NPC) get a turn.

### Initiative
Before each round, one player (decided by the group) makes a DEX contested action against the Dealer. If the player wins, then the party acts first. If the Dealer wins, then the enemies act first. If the Black Joker is drawn on either side, then Dealer is encouraged to add a complication to the combat encounter (e.g. a powder keg blows up, a horse runs wild, etc...)

### Actions 
During a turn, a character may move up to 25 feet and take an action. This can be firing a gun, swinging a weapon, moving again, take a swig of whiskey, or some other action that makes sense given the time constraints.

When it is the party's turn to act, the players may take their turn in any order.

 _Jesse has been discovered sneaking into the camp of the One Eye gang. In order to make a move before the bandits, she flips an Ace of Diamonds and adds her DEX of 4. The Bandits draw an 8 of Spades. The Bandits win and get to attack first._
</details>

### Attacks & Damage
The attacker and defender make a STR contested action for melee attacks and a DEX contested action for ranged attacks. If it is successful, the attack hits. If it fails, the attack misses. The attacker flips 1 card from the deck and deals damaged based on the Tier of card flipped.

 _A nearby bandit rushes Jesse, swinging its club at her, who has 5 HP. The club is a hand weapon that deals 1/3/4. Jesse's player makes a STR contested action and draws a 4 of Diamonds and adds no bonus for her STR. The Bandit flips a King of Clubs and adds +1 from his STR. Jesse can't beat a 14 with the cards in hand, so the Bandit hits and flips a card for the club's damage. He flips an 8. The 8 is tier 2. Jesse takes 3 damage and has 2 HP remaining._
 
 _Jesse quickly draws her Brace of pistols and fires at the bandit with the club. She makes a DEX contested action. She draws an 8 of Clubs and adds her 4 DEX for a total of 12. The Bandit flips a Queen of Hearts. The players tie, but Jesse's 8 of Clubs trumps the Queen of Hearts, and her shots connect! Jesse then flips a 9 of Spades. The Brace of Pistols is a Field weapon (1/3/5). The bandit takes 2 damage to his HP and 1 to his GRT. He makes a 7 GRT contested action. He flips an Ace of Hearts and dies._

### Multiple Enemy Attackers
If multiple attackers target the same PC, the Dealer's attack is **enhanced**. Addtionally, if the PC is hit, the final damage is increased by a total of 1.

### Attack Modifiers
If fighting from an advantagous position (such as against a helpless foe, or through a well coordinated attack), the attack is **enhanced**, the attacker draws 1 extra card for the contested action and adds the value, but not the suit. Addtionally, the attacker may cheat damage, following normal rules for Jokers.

If fighting from a poor position (such as in the dark, or while riding on a galloping horse), the attack is considered **impaired**, the attacker draws 1 extra card and must use the lower of two results. Impaired attacks *cannot* be cheated.

### Critical Damage
Damage that reduces a target's HP below 0 carries over to GRT, reducing it until all damage has been dealt. They must make a 10 GRT save or take **critical damage**.

Any PC that fails the GRT contested action suffers critical damage and is out of the fight. If their wounds are treated and they're able to rest, they will recover. If left untreated, they die within the hour.

### Ability Score loss
If a PC's GRT is reduced to below 0, they die and their story ends.

Sometimes PCs will find a snake in their boot, or that someone has poisoned the waterhole. These traps and dangers will reduce a character's Ability scores. This impacts what a player adds to contested actions. If a player has 0 in an ability score and takes damage from a trap then they immediately take a deblitating condition. These conditions can be healed like any other Ability score loss. Each debilitating condition applies a -1 to the character's contested actions for that stat and takes up 1 inventory slot.
STR: Injured
DEX: Hobbled
WIL: Shocked

Players can accumulate multiples of the above conditions, but if they gather 1 of each, then they become incapable of continuing to adventure as they're just too deblitated to continue. If a character accumulates more conditions than the associated ability score that character dies (e.g. a character with 3 WIL and receive 3 Shocked conditions and generally be okay. If they receive a 4th Shocked condition, then that character dies).

### Scars
When damage to a PC reduces their HP to exactly 0, they may be changed by the hand fate has dealt them and changed forever. See the [**Scars**] table for more.

### Death
When a character dies, the player is free to create a new character or take control of a hireling. The immediately join the party in order to reduce downtime. If the player takes control of a hireling, they immediately shuffle their hand, discard pile, and deck, Draw 3 cards and divide them by suit. They then shuffle those cards back into the deck and draw 5 cards, as though it were a new adventure day.

### Posses
Large groups of similar fighters, like bandits, outlaws, lawmen are treated as a single **posse**. When a posse takes critical damage, it is routed or otherwise weakend. When it reaches 0 STR, it is destroyed.

Attacks against a posse by individuals are **impaired**
Attacks against individuals by a posse are **enhanced** and increase the final damage by 3 (this overrides the additional 1 damage from multiple attackers, as a posse is already a group of multiple attackers just more organized).

### Turning Tail
Running away from a gunfight always requires a 11 DEX contested action, as well as a safe destination. This is why groups of bandits and outlaws may have several safe houses or hideouts to retreat to when a plan goes poorly. If the save is successful, the party is able to escape successfully. If it fails, they can still run away but there will be complications or consequences for doing so.

### Scars
When an attack reduces a PC's HP to exactly 0, they are uniquely impacted. Compare the result on the table below to the amount of HP lost. For example, if a PC went from 4 HP to 0 HP, they would look at entry #4 (Broken Limb). They would then draw 1 card to see what limb was broken.
