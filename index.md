Tombstone - Grit & Determination is an [adventure game](http://questingblog.com/adventure-game-vs-osr/) about exploring the badlands around Thunder Mesa County, a land filled with adventure, odd folk, adventure, and danger in them thar hills. Character creation is quick and random needingly only a deck of cards. Advancement is based on play rather than classes or laid out archetypes. It is based on [Cairn](https://cairnrpg.com/) by Yochai Gal and [Into the Odd](https://freeleaguepublishing.com/shop/into-the-odd/) by Chris McDowall. The game is written by Tom Sweo
