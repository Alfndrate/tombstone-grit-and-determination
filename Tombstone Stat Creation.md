***Character Creation***

**Name, Background, Traits**
Before you start draw, choose your character's name and background. A PC's background influences their knowledge and skills. 

Stat Generation:
Players will shuffle a standard 52 card deck including the red and black jokers.
Players will generate 3 hands of 5 cards and add up the quality of cards drawn, and assign them to your stats in order.
Black Joker: 0
Ace through 5: 1
6 through 10: 2
Jack through King: 3
Red Joker: 4

There is a chance that a character gets a number higer than 18. If a character would have an ability score over 18 that ability score is 18, and any remaining points are transferred to the character's Luck ability.

Once each hand is drawn, note any pairs.

**Ability Scores**
Player Characters (PCs) have just four attributes:
Strength (STR), Dexterity (DEX), Grit (GRT), and Luck (Lck). When creating a PC, the player should draw 3 hands of 5 for each of their character’s ability scores, in order. They may then swap any two of the results. They also have "fourth" ability called Luck. This ability is a pool that fills and empties throughout play and can start filled if a character is lucky enough to have an ability score over 18.

**Hit Protection**
Draw 2 cards and use the above quality to determine starting Hit Protection, add the number of pairs to starting Hit Protection.

**Inventory**

Characters have a total of 10 inventory slots: a backpack with six slots, one slot for each hand, and two slots for their upper body (such as the belt, chest, or head).

Most items take up one slot, and small items can be bundled together. Slots are abstract and can be rearranged per the Warden’s discretion.

Bulky items take up two slots and are typically two-handed or awkward to carry. Anyone carrying a full inventory (i.e. filling all 10 slots) is reduced to 0 HP.

A PC cannot carry more items than their inventory allows. Carts (which must be pulled with both hands), horses, or mules can increase inventory. Hirelings can also be paid to carry equipment.
