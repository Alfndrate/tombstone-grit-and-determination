***Character Creation***

**Name, Background, Traits
Before you start draw, choose your character's name and background. A PC's background influences their knowledge and skills. 

Stat Generation:
Players will shuffle a standard 52 card deck including the red and black jokers.
Players will generate 3 hands of 5 cards and add up the quality of cards drawn, and assign them to your stats in order.
Black Joker: 0
Ace through 5: 1
6 through 10: 2
Jack through King: 3
Red Joker: 4

Once each hand is drawn, note any pairs.

**Ability Scores**
Player Characters (PCs) have just three attributes:
Strength (STR), Dexterity (DEX), and Grit (GRT). When creating a PC, the player should draw 3 hands of 5 for each of their character’s ability scores, in order. They may then swap any two of the results.

**Hit Protection**
Draw 2 cards and use the above quality to determine starting Hit Protection, add the number of pairs to starting Hit Protection.

**Inventory**

Characters have a total of 10 inventory slots: a backpack with six slots, one slot for each hand, and two slots for their upper body (such as the belt, chest, or head).

Most items take up one slot, and small items can be bundled together. Slots are abstract and can be rearranged per the Warden’s discretion.

Bulky items take up two slots and are typically two-handed or awkward to carry. Anyone carrying a full inventory (i.e. filling all 10 slots) is reduced to 0 HP.

A PC cannot carry more items than their inventory allows. Carts (which must be pulled with both hands), horses, or mules can increase inventory. Hirelings can also be paid to carry equipment.
Starting Gear

All PCs begin with:

    Three days’ rations (one slot)
    A torch (one slot)
    10 dollars

--Roll once on each of the Starting Gear tables to determine your PC’s armor, weapons, tools, and equipment. If indicated, roll on the Spellbooks table with a d100 (or roll 2d10, using one die as the ones place, and the other as the tens place). Pick only one item for each result.

--See the Equipment List for related armor, damage, and slot values. Smaller items can sometimes be bundled together into one slot.

--If you would like something closer to traditional classes, refer to the list of Optional Gear Packages.
