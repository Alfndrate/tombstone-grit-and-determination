***Character Creation***

**Name, Background, Traits
Before you start draw, choose your character's name and background. A PC's background influences their knowledge and skills. 

Stat Generation:
Players will shuffle a standard 52 card deck including the red and black jokers.
Players will generate 3 hands of 5 cards and add up the quality of cards drawn, and assign them to your stats in order.
Black Joker: 0
Ace through 5: 1
6 through 10: 2
Jack through King: 3
Red Joker: 4

Once each hand is drawn, note any pairs.

**Ability Scores**
Player Characters (PCs) have just three attributes:
Strength (STR), Dexterity (DEX), and Grit (GRT). When creating a PC, the player should draw 3 hands of 5 for each of their characterâ€™s ability scores, in order. They may then swap any two of the results.

**Hit Protection**
Draw 2 cards and use the above quality to determine starting Hit Protection, add the number of pairs to starting Hit Protection.
